## Assignment:

The final project will be prepared in groups of 3-4 people. The project requires an application
of the corpus processing or annotation methods covered in the course on the Horizons
corpus, published in English, German and French. Each group will prepare a presentation
introducing their topic and prepare a project report describing the details of the selected
processing and annotation methods and an analysis of the linguistic features of the resulting
methods.


Each group will prepare a 15-min. presentation describing
1. The description of the chosen application
2. The general processing or analysis system to be implemented
3. The required methods used in the system
4. Challenges relevant to the application or different methods
5. Outcomes of the project and potential usage in linguistic studies or language and
media technolgy.
